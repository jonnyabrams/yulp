# Yulp

A Yelp clone using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node).

Users can register, log in, add a restaurant, browse a table of restaurants (they can update or delete a restaurant but only if it's one they added themselves) and write reviews along with a rating out of 5 stars.

There's also a search bar that filters the table of restaurants by either their name or location.

## Improvements I'd Like to Make

Certainly the design! I didn't spend a great deal of time on it as I was mostly using this as an exercise to refamiliarise myself with PostgreSQL. If I revisit this project then I'd also like to add functionality for filtering restaurants by rating and price range.
